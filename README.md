# prework-study-guide
## Description

This studyguide was designed for bootcamp students to study and apply the topics covered in the prework guide. It was created to assist students who are new to coding languages and serves as an introduction to the basics of software development. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. I learned to problem solving and perserverance when faced with unexpected errors and bugs. I also learned to be careful and meticulous with my code to ensure proper operability.
